Note to anyone who takes a look at these files.

These R code files were created in the context of conducting longitudinal measurement invariance with data from a 20-item scale that was measured before and
and after a psychotherapy intervention. 

The sample is relatively small at n = 109. The items have a 3-point response scale. 

Given problems with NPD in the polychoric correlation matrix, I decided to smooth the NPD correlation matrix so that it was positive definite and suitable for 
use in invariance testing. I used the mbend package for smoothing. 

This created the follow-on issue of using a polychoric covariance matrix as input into lavaan for the invariance testing instead of using the raw data.

The files in this github project are the results of my efforts to develop code that will allow me to use polychoric covariances as input. I created this project
and attached the code to facilitate getting advice from the lavaan google group on developing the code for these data prep steps. 

The files are

Creating covariance matrix -- Here I use lavCov to retrieve the polychoric covariance matrix and the additional pieces of input required to run lavaan cfa on a 
covariance matrix.
Seeting the model -- This is the model syntax for the null model when conducting longitudinal measurement invariance testing with ordinal data.
CFA run -- This is the lavaan syntax to run the null model using the covariance matrix as input.

If you see something off in the code, please do let me know.

For anyone who is interested in the article that provided the model syntax, the full reference is below. I strongly recommend the article, it is a good overview of doing
these analyses and the authors are generous enough to have included R, MPlus, and OpenMX code for doing longitudinal measurement invariance testing with ordinal data.
